# Introduction to Arrays  in Java
by Chris O'Brien

-----

## General Overview
This is a unit for my AP CS A course.  We'll be introducing Arrays  in Java.  The students have already been introduced to classes, control structures, and other elements of the syntax of Java.  The course relies on a combination of lecture, in class work, and homework (frequently using CodeHS assignments).
---

## Motivation for Unit
The goal is to provide students with a hands on introduction to arrays and array lists in Java, along with a comparison to Python lists (which they've seen in previous classes).

## Standards Referenced

**CSTA 11-12th grade standards: 3B-AP-12: Compare and contrast fundamental data structrues and their uses.**

NY State: 9-12.CT.7
Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data.


## Tools Used

Java (on CodeHS and replit)

## Lessons
Total lenghth: 2 Weeks

1. Represent collections of related primitive or object reference data using one-dimensional (1D) array objects

2. Traverse the elements in a 1-D array

3.  Practice using array traversal in CodeHS.

4. Traverse the elements in a 1-D array with enchanced for loops

5. Identify some common algorithms that use Arrays

6. Practice solving AP free response problems with common algorithms that use arrays

7. Compare and contrast Java Arrays w/ Python lists. Identify problems with Arrays.

8.  Build your own SuperArray class that makes arrays behave like a Python list (Project)

9. Review AP problems involving arrays.

10. Arrays unit test.

## Assesments
In class projects:  build superArray class.

Assessment: MC and free response question test
