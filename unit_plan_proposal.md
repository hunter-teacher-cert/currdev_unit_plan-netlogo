## The course
I'm teaching an introductory programming class that uses Python. I'm using
the CodeHS curriculum, which starts with a unit that introduces programming
using Tracy the Turtle. This is based on a somewhat restricted version of
the Python turtle library.  

## The problem
This is a good introduction to coding, but the CodeHS platform is somewhat
restricted in terms of what you can do.  I'd like to be able to introduce
students to more of the power of programming, especially in terms of
computational modeling, without them having to be experts in Python. I
think that netLogo can be a suitable mechanism for this.

## Unit content
The content will introduce students to the basic syntax of netLogo, give them
a chance to explore available models in netLogo, and also to construct their
own models.  This will come after introducing basic programming concepts with
CodeHS Python, and before we continue with more Python content.
