# Introduction to Arrays and ArrayLists in Java
by Chris O'Brien

-----

## General Overview
This is a unit for my AP CS A course.  We'll be introducing Arrays and ArrayLists in Java.  The students have already been introduced to classes, control structures, and other elements of the syntax of Java.  The course relies on a combination of lecture, in class work, and homework (frequently using CodeHS assignments).
---

## Motivation for Unit
The goal is to provide students with a hands on introduction to arrays and array lists in Java, along with a comparison to Python lists (which they've seen in previous classes).  

---

## Standards Referenced

**CSTA 11-12th grade standards: 3B-AP-12: Compare and contrast fundamental data structrues and their uses.**

In this unit we're discussing the use of arrays and ArrayLists within Java and between Java and Python. 



## Tools Used

Java (on CodeHS and replit)

## Lessons
Total lenghth: 2 Weeks

1. Represent collections of related primitive or object reference data using one-dimensional (1D) array objects

2. Traverse the elements in a 1-D array

3.  Traverse the elements in a 1D array object using an enhanced for loop

4. Build a Mancala AI with Arrays and enhanced for loops

5. Identify some common algorithms that use Arrays

6. Compare and contrast Java Arrays w/ Python lists  

7.  Build your own SuperArray class that makes arrays behave like a Python list (Project)

8. Represent collections of objects using ArrayLists

9. Traversing ArrayList and using ArrayList with an enhanced for loops

10. Assessment: MC quiz and Performance Task: Re-implement Mancala with ArrayLists

## Assesments
In class projects: Build Mancala AI with arraylists, build superArray classic
Assessment: MC quiz and performance task: Re-implement Mancala with ArrayLists
